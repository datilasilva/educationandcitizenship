        <p>Brazilians!</p>
        <p>I lived in the city of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%A3o_Jos%C3%A9_da_Safira" target="_blank">S√£o Jos√© da Safira</a>  in Brazil and there I had education as something very close because my family is one of the warriors of the Brazilian Educational System.</p>

        <p class="textoimagem"> Description of images: conversations with students about racism. This is me; my brother-in-law is a teacher and principal of the school in a small district; Brazil Independence Day.

      <section id="desenvolvimento">
        <h3 class="titulo-verde"> What do we have?</h3>
          <p>At the end of the Faculty of Law, I presented my final paperwork stating that education is fundamental for the formation of each citizen.</p>
          <p>You can ask me:</p>
          <p class="indaga√ßao"><i>"But is there no education system in your country?"</i></p> 
          <p>Yes, there is. </p>
          <p>And we have many warrior teachers who do this daily in a very difficult system.</p>
          <p>In the reality that I lived during my life, we studied basic education subjects that are fundamental(Mathematics, Portuguese, Sciences ...). However, important issues such as basic laws, technology and economic issues are often left out of the educational system.</p>
          <p>Bringing it as a <i>"dejavu"</i>, I remember my defense in law school:</p>
          <p class="comentario">I believe that we cannot demand the rights that we do not know.</p>
          <p>Just saying <i>"Ok ... there is an education system here",</i> but in my opinion it is not enough, because mainly the poorest do not know their basic rights.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="conclusao">
        <h3 class="titulo-verde">Who could we be?</h3>
        
        <p>The solution may be basic legal disciplines.</p>
        <p> A discipline that didactically explains about:</p> 
        <p class="pergunta"><i>‚úèÔ∏èChildren and youth in Brazilian Law  in cases of sexual abuse, intimidation, among others</i></p> 
        <p class="solu√ßao">Children are able to understand the acts and consequences. simply teaching about laws that protect children and young people can give them the courage to look for people who can help in cases of abuse or bullying, because they will understand that there are people to help and criminals will be punished</p>
        <p class="pergunta"><i>‚úèÔ∏èLabor Law in legal issues about first job, employee documents, working hours, obligations and duties</i></p> 
        <p class="solu√ßao">Speaking in class on topics like, "What is right in the work environment?", "How long should I work for?", It will prevent illegalities or abuses and improve the work environment for the future, because young people can think "ok ", It is not correct" and report the situation.
          We often accept a situation because we do not understand that it is wrong</p>
        <p class="pergunta"><i>‚úèÔ∏èConstitutional Law about what I can demand from the government</i></p>
        <p class="solu√ßao">Based on my experience withas a  lawyer, I can say: people do not know their rights guaranteed by the Constitution of Brazil.
         We need to learn that if a government has made an investment in accordance with the law, it is a constitutional obligation and not a favor to the community.
         this can change the minds of the population that will demand more and more Brazilian politicians and, perhaps, stop the cycle of corruption</p>
        <p>I really believe that education is the foundation of the whole country and an education in which each person becomes an individual aware of their rights would be the purest representation of the power to teach.</p>

      <div id="aplication">
        <p> <i>About application task out with the old school. </i></p>
        <p>The school can more.</p>
        <p>The school can always do more.</p>
        <p>Many Brazilian children go to school because they do not have food at home and need the snack offered.</p>
        <p>So ... the school can do more.</p>
        <p>The school can teach much more than usual: education can save children, adolescents and future adults from being victims or becoming criminals when they gain ‚Äúthe power‚Äù to demand from the State their rights as citizens and understand about the punishment of laws .</p>
